### Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This site showcases some of my projects as well as some more information about me.

Use the custom terminal to navigate my portfolio, email me a personal message, and more!

### Tech Stack

The site uses React, with a bunch of packages to help simplify development. React-Terminal and Email.js are two of the big ones.

### Development Environment

To play around with the site locally, clone the repo and run `npm i`. You can then boot up the project using `npm run dev` and go from there!
